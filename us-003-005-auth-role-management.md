# Story 003.005: User Role Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** administrator of a business,
**I want** to be able to assign and modify user roles (e.g., Owner, Sales Associate, End-Client) to registered users,
**so that** I can control their access permissions and functionalities within the ForgePoint platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Given I am an authenticated administrator, when I navigate to the user management section, then I should be able to view a list of all registered users and their current roles.
2.  Given I select a user from the list, when I am able to view and edit their assigned roles, then I should be able to update their roles.
3.  Given I modify a user's role, then the changes should take effect immediately or upon the user's next login, and their access permissions should be updated accordingly.
4.  Given I attempt to assign an invalid role to a user, then the system should prevent this action and display an error message.
5.  Given I am an administrator, then I should not be able to revoke my own primary administrative role without assigning another administrator.
6.  Given a user's role is updated, then this action should be logged in the system's audit trail.
