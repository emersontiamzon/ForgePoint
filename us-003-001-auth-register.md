# Story 003.001: User Registration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to register for an account with my email and password,
**so that** I can gain access to the ForgePoint platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Given I am on the registration page, when I provide a valid email address and a strong password, and confirm the password, then my account should be successfully created.
2.  Given my account is created, then I should receive a confirmation email to verify my address.
3.  Given I attempt to register with an email address that is already in use, then the system should inform me that the email is already registered and prevent duplicate account creation.
4.  Given I attempt to register with a password that does not meet the strength requirements, then the system should display an error message outlining the password policy (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
5.  Given I do not confirm my password correctly, then the system should display an error indicating the passwords do not match.
6.  Given I have successfully registered, then I should be redirected to the login page or automatically logged in.
